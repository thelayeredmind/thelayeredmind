- 👋 Hi, I’m @thelayeredmind
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming Languages, Cognition, Philosophy and Art and the vast oasis of topics inbetween
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to become a polyglot, learning concepts from new languages and applying them to my personal projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative applications of all forms, to hone my language knowledge
